# Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸ“ˆ

This repo will be a common place for a collection of notes, programming experiments, graphical illustrations, and general commentary on the subject of Data Structures and Algorithms, as I study and attempt to comprehend this subfield of computer science.

## Rules and Outline

The structure of this repo will follow the guidelines below:<br>
- For programming languages only JavaScript, C++, or Python will be used
- Asymptotic analysis will be performed before timing experiments
- After analysis, a more detailed code walkthrough will be added as part of "notes"
- Timing experiments will be conducted to measure the correctness of analysis
- The results from all timing experiments will be graphed on GoogleSheets
- Graphs used to plot timing experiments will be scatter plots with trend-lines
- A sample data size of 1000 - 5000 is going to be used
- After analysis, the similarities and differences between this and other algorithms will be discussed as part of "commentary"

## Folder Structure

- Analysis folder (contains the results from asymptotic analysis and related code)
- Notes folder (contains commentary on prior analysis, and related algorithms)
- Img folder (contains images of handwritten work, graphs, and etc) 

## ðŸ“„ðŸ˜Ž

This README file will acts as a rulebook for myself while documenting my journey through this subject.<br>
And it'll also double as a guide for anyone interested in looking through this stuff.
