# Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸ“ˆ

This repo contains a collection of notes, programming experiments, graphical illustrations, and general commentary on the subject of Data Structures and Algorithms. Documenting my educational journey through this subfield of computer science.

## General Repo Outline

- Programming language: Python
- Asymptotic analysis: performed as part of practice work
- Timing experiments: conducted to measure the correctness of analysis
- The results from all timing experiments are graphed using GoogleSheets
- Practice: Problem solving through LeetCode and some Abstract problems

## Folder Structure

- Practise folder (contains practice work)
- Notes folder (contains code Analysis, Algorithms, and Data Structure notes)
- Images folder (contains images of handwritten work, graphs, and etc)

This README file acts as a rulebook for myself while documenting my journey.<br>
It'll also double as a guide for anyone interested in looking through this repo.
