# Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸ“ˆ

This repo contains a collection of notes, programming experiments, graphical illustrations, and general commentary on the subject of Data Structures and Algorithms. Documenting my educational journey through this subfield of computer science.

## General Repo Outline

- For programming languages some C++ but mainly Python is used
- Asymptotic analysis is be performed before any timing experiments
- Timing experiments are conducted to measure the correctness of analysis
- The results from all timing experiments are graphed using GoogleSheets
- Various problem solving strategies from multiple problem domains are explored
- Their solutions are implemented using a varity of Data Structures

## Folder Structure

- Practise folder (contains practice work)
- Notes folder (contains code analysis, algorithms, and Data Structure notes)
- Images folder (contains images of handwritten work, graphs, and etc) 
- Problem Solving folder (contains solutions/strategies for solving various abstract problems)

## ðŸ“„ðŸ˜Ž

This README file acts as a rulebook for myself while documenting my journey.<br>
It'll also double as a guide for anyone interested in looking through this repo.
