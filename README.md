# Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸ“ˆ

This repo will serve as a common place for a collection of notes, programming experiments, graphical illustrations, and general commentary on the subject of Data Structures and Algorithms, as I study and attempt to comprehend this subfield of computer science. The notes, graphical illustrations, and general commentary will be added using .md files, while the programming experiments will be handled using python and C++ mainly.

## Rules and Outline

The whole point of this repo is to document the results from asymptotic analysis on various algorithms, show their correlation to timing experiments, and explain the code thats being analyzed. As such to structure this repo, it's contents will adhere to the following:<br>
- For programming languages only JavaScript, C++, or Python will be used
- All algorithms, will undergo full algorithm analysis before any timing experiments
- The results from all timing experiments will be graphed on GoogleSheets
- Graphs used to plot timing experiments will be scatter plots with trend-lines
- A sample data size of 1000 - 5000 is going to be used
- After algorithm analysis, the similarities and differences between this and other algorithms will be discussed as part of "commentary"

## ðŸ“„ðŸ˜Ž

This README file will acts as a rulebook for myself while documenting my journey through this subject.<br>
And it'll also double as a guide for anyone interested in looking through this stuff.
