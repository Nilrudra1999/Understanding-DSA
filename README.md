# Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸ“ˆ

This repo contains a collection of notes, programming experiments, graphical illustrations, and general commentary on the subject of Data Structures and Algorithms. Documenting my educational journey through this subfield of computer science.

## General Repo Outline

- For programming languages; JavaScript, C++, or Python is used
- Asymptotic analysis is be performed before any timing experiments
- Timing experiments are conducted to measure the correctness of analysis
- The results from all timing experiments are graphed using GoogleSheets
- Graphs used to plot timing experiments use scatter plots with trend-lines
- A sample data size of 100+ is used for timing experiments

## Folder Structure

- Analysis folder (contains the results of asymptotic analysis and related code, along with practice work)
- Notes folder (contains commentary on analysis, related algorithms, and Data Structures)
- Img folder (contains images of handwritten work, graphs, and etc)

This README file acts as a rulebook for myself while documenting my journey.<br>
It'll also double as a guide for anyone interested in looking through this repo.
