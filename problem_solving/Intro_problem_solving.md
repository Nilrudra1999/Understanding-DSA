# Introduction to Problem Solving in DSA ⚠️

Problem solving is an essential part of programming and computer science.<br>
However, problem solving is difficult, the solution to every problem is different, and the approaches are different based on the problem's domain. The worst part is, during exams there is no way of knowing what type of problem you may encounter besides the general topics that it'll cover.

Therefore, it would be much easier if there was a system of solving problems universally, no matter the problem domain.<br>
And by system I mean a methodology/approach which can boost the success rate while solving any problem, and it needs to be more detailed than just "get more practice".<br>

Additionally, being able to solve any problem allows individuals to boost their career growth exponentially.<br>
Since the level of growth is often tied to ones ability to generate profit, solving complex problems for a company can generate them an exponential amount of that profit, increasing your own potenial by an untold amount.

## Problem Solving Components/Strategies

So how can the problem of solving problems be approached in a structured manner

- Step 1: Recontextualize the question in layman's terms
- Step 2: Find what value/quantity is being asked to solve
- Step 3: Break the main problem into smaller sub-problems
- Step 4: Solving the sub-problems, provides the components needed to solve the main problem
- Step 5: Finally solve for the main value/quantity
- Step 6: State the results reframed using the question

In programming this means first reframing the problem in an easier to understand context.<br>
Then finding the final piece which our code/program will solve for.<br>
Afterwards, we breakdown the process of getting that piece into smaller parts.<br>
We put the logic together, and frame it in the context of the code.<br>
Lastly we put the code together, which will solve the problem that's being presented.<br>

Finding LeetCode or even random abstract problems and solving them using this approach is the "practice" thats needed.<br>
This will help build those essential problem solving skills.
