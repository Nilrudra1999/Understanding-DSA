# Introduction to Various Problem Solving Strategies

Problem solving is an essential part of programming and computer science.<br>
However, problem solving is hard, the solution to every problem seems different, the approaches seem different and what results may come from solving a problem one way verses another can be correct or incorrect based on the problem's domain. The worst part is that during exams there is no way of knowing what type of problem you may encounter besides the general topic that it'll cover.

Therefore, it would be much more efficient if there was a system of solving problems universally, no matter the problem domain.<br>
And by system I mean a methodology/approach which can boost the chances of solving problems with a higher success rate.<br>
Additionally, this approach needs to be more detailed than just "get more practice".

## Problem Solving Components

1. What is the problem? Representation
2. Approaches

## Problem Representation

Given a problem, there needs to be a way to represent it such that it becomes easier to solve.<br>
The representation needs to match the physical constraints of the problem.<br>

If we are trying to solve the problem of how much sand we need to fill a bucket, a better representation of the problem might be, "how can we determine the volumn of a bucket?". We can then simply buy/get that much sand.

## Possible Problem Solving Methods

Beyond problem representation, we now need an approach for finding a solution. Or sometimes if a representation is too complex to represent clearly in an easy alternative manner then we go ahead with an approach which will help us regardless.

### Proximity method

Where you look at a problem from start to end, asking what is needed to solve this problem?<br>
Then what do you need to solve that solution?<br>

If your hungry you need to eat.<br>
How can you eat? By making food.<br>
What food should you make? Eggs.<br>
Fried or boiled? Fried.<br>
How would you fry them?..... and so on.

### Fractional method

This method focus on means-to-an-end, where no matter the number of steps taken to reach the goal. As long as the goal is reached its fine.

Much like the tower of Hanoi, where we start with a solid goal in mind.<br>
Getting the biggest ring to the last stick. From there we can take actions to making that happen.<br>
Because once thats achieved all the other pieces fall into place.

## Final Steps to Solving Problems 

1. begin by representing the problem visually
2. pick an approach to work towards the solution
3. layout what you know and what is assumed
4. settle on a solution and test it
5. implement the solution once satisfied

This time with enough practice, solving problems with the above steps as a guide, we can hopefully shorten the time it takes to find a solution by half.
