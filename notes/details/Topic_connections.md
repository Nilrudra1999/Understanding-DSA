# General Connections between the various topics of DSA

DSA is comprised of two main areas of study, Data Structures and Algorithms, which go hand-in-hand to form solutions for problems.<br>
When a problem is encountered, some input is received thats needed to find the solution, the inputs are either stored/accessed to compute a value which becomes the output/solution. Data Structures and Algorithms are used in the process of creating the code to compute these solutions.

### Areas of Study

This subject can be broken down into smaller portions which all have their own intricacies.<br>
To better understand these intricacies and how they're all related the topics can be broken down, like in the chart below. Afterwards each topic can be explored to see how the individual portion connect to others, or if they're connected at all.<br>

| ADTs   | Algorithms | ADT's connections | Algorithm's connections | Studied? |
|--------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| Lists  | Searching  |                   |                         |          |
| Tables | Sorting    |                   |                         |          |
| Graphs | Graph      |                   |                         |          |
| Trees  | Iterative  |                   |                         |          |
| Heaps  | Recursive  |                   |                         |          |
| BST    |            |                   |                         |          |

Questions to answer when studying the topics:
- What are these topics
- When are they used
- How are they the same
- How are they different
- Why use one over the other
